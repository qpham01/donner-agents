Here are the compelling arguments in favor of the motion that birthright citizenship should be granted to all children born in the United States:

- **Constitutional Foundation**: The 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution clearly states that "all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens." This fundamental legal principle enshrines the idea that all individuals born on U.S. soil, regardless of parental status, deserve citizenship.

- **Promotes Equality**: Granting citizenship to all children born in the U.S. promotes equality and prevents discrimination based on nationality, ethnicity, or immigration status. It ensures that every citizen has equal rights, opportunities, and access to public resources.

- **Social Integration**: Birthright citizenship fosters a sense of belonging and national identity. Children born in the U.S. are fully integrated into society from birth, which aids in their development as responsible citizens and contributes to social cohesion.

- **Economic Benefits**: Citizens contribute to the economy through taxation and labor; children born in the U.S. who automatically receive citizenship grow up to become productive members of society. They are likely to participate in the workforce, pay taxes, and stimulate the economy.

- **Public Health and Safety**: When all children born in the U.S. have guaranteed citizenship, it encourages parents to seek necessary health care and educational services without fear of deportation, which ultimately benefits public health, safety, and social welfare.

- **International Standing**: Consistency in citizenship laws aligns with international norms and principles of human rights. Upholding birthright citizenship strengthens the U.S. position as a leader in human rights and democracy globally.

- **Reducing Statelessness**: Granting automatic citizenship helps reduce the occurrence of statelessness, where individuals are not recognized as citizens by any country. This can prevent generations of individuals who lack legal rights and protections.

- **Encouraging Family Stability**: Birthright citizenship can foster family stability, as parents are less likely to face deportation or separation from their citizen children, which strengthens families and communities.

By implementing birthright citizenship for all children born in the United States, we uphold constitutional values, foster equality, enhance economic prosperity, and promote social harmony in our diverse nation. This policy is not only just but essential for the future of the country.
